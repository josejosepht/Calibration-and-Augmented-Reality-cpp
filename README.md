# Calibration-and-Augmented-Reality-cpp
The repository contains the code files to calibrate a camera and then use the calibration to generate virtual objects in a scene. The program detects a target and then places a virtual object in the scene relative to the target that moves and orients itself correctly given motion of the camera or target.
